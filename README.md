# SWARMPY üêú

Swarmpy is a (will be) a Python 3.10 framework to solve some discrete and combinatorial NP-Hard problems in Machine Learning worklows.

First application is on feature selection. The main contribution is to go beyond limited univariate selections. 
One should keep in mind that : 
\begin{math}
\min\limits_{s_k 	
\subset [\![0,n]\!]^k} {\mathbb{\hat{E}}\limits_{x,y\sim\mathcal{D}}[\mathscr{l}(y,f(x_{|s_k})]} \leq \min\limits_{s_k\subset [\![0,n]\!]^k} \sum\limits_{i \in s_k}\mathbb{\hat{E}}\limits_{x,y\sim\mathcal{D}}[\mathscr{l}(y,f(x_{|i})]
\end{math}

In plain english : the best subset of features of cardinal k for optimazing the empirical error is not always the subset composed of the k best features for prediction. 

It can be a good approximation and has the merit of avoiding solving this combinatorial problem. Yet it is not optimal. Here, we are proposing to solve the problem using a meta-heuristic stochastic algorithm to find near-optimal solutions.
